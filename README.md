# Writing a Linux Daemon Example

This repository contains a simple example of writing a Linux daemon in C. A daemon is a background process that runs independently of the controlling terminal.

## Overview

The `daemon_example.c` file in this repository provides a basic example of how to create a daemon process. It includes the necessary steps such as forking, closing file descriptors, changing the working directory, and handling signals.

## Prerequisites

Before running the example, ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your Linux system.

## Build

To build the daemon, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc daemon_example.c -o daemon_example

Run

To run the daemon, execute the following command:

bash

./daemon_example

This will fork the process and run the daemon in the background. The daemon process will log messages to the system log.
Stop

To stop the daemon, find its process ID (PID) using tools like ps or pgrep and send the SIGTERM signal:

bash

kill -15 <daemon_pid>
